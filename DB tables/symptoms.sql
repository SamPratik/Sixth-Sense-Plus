(2, 'Allergy', 'An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance.\r\nAllergies are very common. They''re thought to affect more than one in four people in the UK at some point in their lives.<br/>\r\nThey are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren''t previously allergic to.<br/>\r\nHaving an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control.

For example, you may have a runny nose if exposed to pollen, develop a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick if you eat something you''re allergic to.\r\nSee your GP if you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something.

(3, 'Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Your child passes a hearing test, but is diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD). How is it possible to have an auditory disorder when you don&rsquo;t have a hearing impairment?<br/>\r\nChildren with APD typically have normal hearing. But they struggle to process and make meaning of sounds. This is especially true when there are background noises.<br/>\r\nResearchers don&rsquo;t fully understand where things break down between what the ear hears and what the brain processes. But the result is clear: Kids with APD can have trouble making sense of what other people say.[1]<br/>\r\nTypically the brain processes sounds seamlessly and almost instantly. Most people can quickly interpret what they hear. But with APD, some kind of glitch delays or &ldquo;scrambles&rdquo; that process. To a child with APD, &ldquo;Tell me how the chair and the couch are alike&rdquo; might sound like &ldquo;Tell me how a cow and hair are like.&rdquo;<br/>\r\nMany conditions, including ADHD and autism, can affect a child&rsquo;s ability to listen and understand what they hear. What makes APD different is that the problem lies with understanding the sounds of spoken language, not the meaning of what&rsquo;s being said.[2]<br/>\r\nSome educators and other professionals question or doubt a diagnosis of APD. Not all professionals see it as a specific disorder. The medical profession didn&rsquo;t start seriously studying APD in children until 1977.[3] Three decades later, there&rsquo;s still confusion about APD.<br/>\r\n', '&bull;	Delayed language development<br/>\r\n&bull;	Inability to listen effectively<br/>\r\n&bull;	Trouble in sequencing the sounds of words<br/>\r\n&bull;	Difficulty perceiving high frequency sounds: &lsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;f&rsquo; &lsquo;s&rsquo;, &lsquo;k&rsquo;, &lsquo;p&rsquo;, &lsquo;th&rsquo;, &lsquo;sh&rsquo;<br/>\r\n&bull;	Confusion when faced with similar sounds: eg. &lsquo;da&rsquo; and &lsquo;ba&rsquo; <br/>\r\n&bull;	Poor comprehension in a noisy environment <br/>\r\n&bull;	Easily distracted by irrelevant background sounds <br/>\r\n&bull;	Poor speech comprehension, often asking &lsquo;What?&rsquo;<br/>\r\n&bull;	Misunderstanding and poor memory for oral messages <br/>\r\n&bull;	Inconsistent responses to the same auditory stimuli <br/>\r\n&bull;	Inability to follow directions<br/>\r\n&bull;	Difficulty in expressing desires, often blaming the other person for not understanding <br/>\r\n&bull;	Poor phonemic awareness contributing to poor reading, spelling or comprehension <br/>\r\n', 'Auditory Processing Difficulties are frequently treated with a range of one-on-one interventions such as speech therapy or phonemic awareness. APD can also be treated through Auditory Training.<br/>\r\n\r\nAuditory Training is different to music therapy. Music therapy relies on the psychological role of music in aiding relaxation, energy or concentration. In terms of its effect on the ear, music therapy is like a massage, whereas auditory training can be thought of as physiotherapy. Auditory training involves exposing the ear to carefully monitored sound to strengthen neurological pathways and train the ear to listen more accurately. This has a direct and strengthening effect on the muscles in the middle ear and the central nervous system.<br/>\r\n', 'audiologist.php', 20, 'language listen directions confusion ', 'audiologist'),
(4, 'Gum Disease', 'If you have been told you have periodontal (gum) disease, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many adults in the U.S. currently have some form of the disease. Periodontal diseases range from simple gum inflammation to serious disease that results in major damage to the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth. In the worst cases, teeth are lost.<br/>\r\nWhether your gum disease is stopped, slowed, or gets worse depends a great deal on how well you care for your teeth and gums every day, from this point forward.\r\n', '&bull;	Bad breath that won&rsquo;t go away<br/>\r\n&bull;	Red or swollen gums<br/>\r\n&bull;	Tender or bleeding gums<br/>\r\n&bull;	Painful chewing<br/>\r\n&bull;	Loose teeth<br/>\r\n&bull;	Sensitive teeth<br/>\r\n&bull;	Receding gums or longer appearing teeth<br/>\r\nAny of these symptoms may be a sign of a serious problem, which should be checked by a dentist. At your dental visit the dentist or hygienist should:<br/>\r\n&bull;	Ask about your medical history to identify underlying conditions or risk factors (such as smoking) that may contribute to gum disease.<br/>\r\n&bull;	Examine your gums and note any signs of inflammation.<br/>\r\n&bull;	Use a tiny ruler called a &ldquo;probe&rdquo; to check for and measure any pockets. In a healthy mouth, the depth of these pockets is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters. This test for pocket depth is usually painless.<br/>\r\n', 'The main goal of treatment is to control the infection. The number and types of treatment will vary, depending on the extent of the gum disease. Any type of treatment requires that the patient keep up good daily care at home. The doctor may also suggest changing certain behaviors, such as quitting smoking, as a way to improve treatment outcome', 'dentist.php', 20, 'bleeding sensitive Loose breath ', 'dentist'),
(5, 'Deppressive Disorders', 'A depressive disorder is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. It interferes with daily life, normal functioning, and causes pain for both the person with the disorder and those who care about him or her.<br/>\r\nA depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away. People with a depressive illness cannot merely "pull themselves together" and get better. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Depression is a common but serious illness, and most people who experience it need treatment to get better. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression.\r\n', '&bull;	Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood<br/>\r\n&bull;	Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism<br/>\r\n&bull;	Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness<br/>\r\n&bull;	Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex<br/>\r\n&bull;	Decreased energy, fatigue, being "slowed down"<br/>\r\n&bull;	Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions<br/>\r\n&bull;	Insomnia, early morning awakening or oversleeping<br/>\r\n&bull;	Appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain<br/>\r\n&bull;	Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts<br/>\r\n&bull;	Restlessness, irritability<br/>\r\n&bull;	Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain<br/>\r\n', 'Depression, even the most severe cases, is a highly treatable disorder. As with many illnesses, the earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is and the greater the likelihood that recurrence can be prevented.<br/>\r\nAppropriate treatment for depression starts with a physical examination by a physician. Certain medications, as well as some medical conditions such as viral infections or a thyroid disorder, can cause the same symptoms as depression, and the physician should rule out these possibilities through examination, interview and lab tests. If a physical cause for the depression is ruled out, a psychological evaluation that includes a mental status exam should be done either by the physician or by referral to a mental health professional.<br/>\r\nHe or she should discuss any family history of depression including their treatment, and get a complete history of symptoms, such as when they started, how long they have lasted, how severe they are, whether the patient had them before. And if so, whether the symptoms were treated and what treatment was given. The doctor should ask about alcohol and drug use, and if the patient has thoughts about death or suicide.<br/>\r\nOnce diagnosed, a person with depression can be treated with a number of methods. The most common treatments are medication and psychotherapy.<br/>\r\n', 'psychiatrist.php', 10, 'Insomnia suicide weight mood', 'psychiatrist'),
(6, 'Asthma', 'Asthma is a long-term lung condition.  People with asthma have sensitive airways in their lungs which react to triggers, causing a &lsquo;flare-up&rsquo;. In a flare-up, the muscles around the airway squeeze tight, the airways swell and become narrow and there is more mucus. These things make it harder to breathe.<br/>\r\nAn asthma flare-up can come on slowly (over hours, days or even weeks) or very quickly (over minutes). A sudden or severe asthma flare-up is sometimes called an asthma attack.It affects people of all ages. Some people get asthma when they are young; others when they are older.Asthma cannot be cured, but for most people it can be well controlled by following a daily management plan.\r\n', '&bull;	Coughing, especially at night<br/>\r\n&bull;	Wheezing<br/>\r\n&bull;	Shortness of breath<br/>\r\n&bull;	Chest tightness, pain, or pressure<br/>\r\n', '&bull;	Herbs, vitamins, and other supplements<br/>\r\n&bull;	Homeopathy, taking tiny amounts of what triggers your asthma to make you less sensitive to it<br/>\r\n&bull;	Special diets<br/>\r\n&bull;	Acupuncture<br/>\r\n&bull;	Chiropractic<br/>\r\n&bull;	Massage<br/>\r\nA better choice is to lower your stress, which can trigger a flare.

(7, 'Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lung. It can be caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Pneumonia causes inflammation in your lung&rsquo;s air sacs, or alveoli.
